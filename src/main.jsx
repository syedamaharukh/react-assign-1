      React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications.
      It was developed by Facebook and released as an open-source project in 2013.
      React uses a component-based architecture, making code reusable and easier to manage.
      It employs a virtual DOM for fast and efficient updates to the real DOM.
      React supports declarative programming, allowing developers to describe what the UI should look like.
      It integrates seamlessly with state management libraries like Redux or Context API.
      React applications can be rendered on the client or server using ReactDOM or Next.js.
      Its ecosystem includes tools like React Router for navigation and hooks for managing side effects and state.
